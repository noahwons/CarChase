#### Description: A graphics based came where a sports car is running from a cop

**What is it?**
This was my first ever python project and, when ran properly, I am extremely proud of it. It was an opportunity for me to experience a graphics based
program combined with object oriented programming. I was and still am incredibly proud of this project, even though it is incredibly bugy.

**SIDENOTE:**
This program uses an outdated graphics library founded by my old programming teacher. Because of this, the program does not seem to function properly on 
newer versions of python and with the use of a virtual enviornment. The game will still run, but every aspect seems to be skewed or incorrect.
